app.getPath('userData') returns the path to the directory where your Electron app stores user-specific data (like settings, files, databases, etc.).
The actual location depends on the platform:
Windows: C:\Users\<YourUser>\AppData\Roaming\<YourAppName>
macOS: /Users/<YourUser>/Library/Application Support/<YourAppName>
Linux: /home/<YourUser>/.config/<YourAppName>
By using app.getPath('userData'), the database file (bloodBank.db) will be stored in this directory, which ensures that it persists between app sessions.
